# Changelog

## 0.1.0-beta.2

- Installer: a setup program with Start menu entry, optional desktop shortcut and a clean uninstall.
- App icon.
- System page: Windows edition and build, hardware, security state and activation, with a copy report button.
- Windows install check: lists the signs that Windows came from a customized image, with the reason for each. It is a hint, not a verdict.
- DNS is now one dropdown with an encryption switch, since only one provider can be active.
- Faster startup state read, about 5 seconds instead of 20 after the DNS entries were added.
- Scrollbar colors follow the theme and the lists leave room for it.
- New tests cover the system report and install check.
